# LinguaSigna Flutter Architecture Documentation

## Project Overview
LinguaSigna is a real-time sign language translation Flutter application supporting ASL (American Sign Language) and GSL (Ghanaian Sign Language) with integrated video conferencing capabilities.

## Architecture Principles

### 🏗️ Clean Architecture
The app follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:
- **Presentation Layer**: UI components, screens, widgets
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, models, enums  
- **Data Layer**: Repositories, services, data sources

### 🎯 State Management
- **Riverpod 2.x** with code generation for type-safe, performant state management
- **Provider selectors** implemented to minimize widget rebuilds
- **Immutable state models** using Equatable for value equality
- **Proper resource disposal** with ref.onDispose() patterns
